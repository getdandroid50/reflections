FC I would have preferred to use the diff from unix. 
   Maybe load the public domain unix tool set, with zip and unzip, compress ...
Other tools/programs that have version control, google docs, wiki , dropbox

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, 
vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
   Dont like the auto saved for code, sometimes ok for raw text files.
